class NidaqBatchedRateCounter:
    '''
    This class implements an NIDAQ batched rate counter utilizing the edge counter 
    interface. This represents one layer of abstraction away from directly interfacing
    with the hardware since the NIDAQ API is qutie complicated.

    Specifically, this class represents a standard rate counter which is structured
    around "batched" data collection wherein the counts are readout in batches of
    some number of clock cycles. A single batch of `N_cycles` clock cycles at frequency
    `clock_rate` then corresponds to a sample over a time period `N_cycles / clock_rate`.

    This class implements the most basic and "natural" version of the rate counter, but
    in most use cases, it is generally preferable to use the sister class
    `NidaqTimedRateCounter` which computes the batch size needed to achieve the a 
    desired sample time.

    Historically, this class was implemented as `daqsamplers.NiDaqDigitalInputRateCounter`
    in `qt3utils`. However we have also merged the `QT3ScanNIDAQEdgeCounterController` 
    class functionality into this class since it largely served as a GUI wrapper.

    Methods
    -------
    configure(config_dict) -> None
        Configures the rate counter to settings with matching keys provided in 
        `config_dict`, leaves values unchanged if not present. Note that this method
        should only be called before starting (or after stopping) the rate counter
        via the `self.start()` method as it will not automatically reconfigure the
        NidaqEdgeCounterInterface.

    start() -> None
        Starts up the rate counter, configures the DAQ via `self._read_samples()`
        then starts up the internal clock if configured to.
        This method must be run externally before attempting to read data.

    stop() -> None
        Waits for any measurements to be completed then stops and closes the clock
        and counter tasks on the DAQ.

    sample_nbatches_raw(n_batches, sum_counts) -> np.ndarray
        Get the counts of `n_batches` of counts from the DAQ where a batch is defined 
        by `self.num_data_samples_per_batch` clock cycles. Returns an array of tuples
        (counts, number of samples) for each batch measured. If `sum_counts` is `True`,
        then the counts and number of samples for all batches are summed.

    sample_nbatches_counts(n_batches, sum_counts) -> np.ndarray
        Same as `sample_nbatches_raw()` but returns only the counts themselves, possibly
        summed into a single number if `sum_counts` is `True`.

    sample_nbatches_time(n_batches, sum_counts) -> np.ndarray
        Same as `sample_nbatches_raw()` but converts the number of clock cycles into
        time in seconds based off the clock rate.

    sample_nbatches_rate(n_batches, sum_counts) -> np.ndarray
        Same as `sample_nbatches_raw()` but converts the data into a 1-d array of the 
        countrate per batch (or entire measure ment if `sum_counts` is `True`).

    sample_batch_raw() -> np.ndarray
        Samples a single batch and returns the (counts, number of cycles). This method 
        is slightly faster than `sample_nbatches_raw()` as it does not include the logic
        for additional batches.

    sample_batch_counts() -> int
        Same as `sample_nbatches_raw()` but returns only the counts as an integer

    sample_batch_time() -> np.ndarray
        Same as `sample_nbatches_raw()` but converts the number of clock cycles to a
        time in seconds.

    sample_batch_rate() -> float
        Same as `sample_nbatches_raw()` but returns the count rate as a float

    _read_samples() -> (np.ndarray, int)
        Internal method to read out a single batch on the DAQ, returns a tuple of an
        `np.ndarray` of shape (`self.num_data_samples_per_batch`,) where the value at
        each index corresponds to the number of detection events per clock cycle.
        The corresponding int is equal to or less than `self.num_data_samples_per_batch`
        and corresponds to the number of samples actually read out (on rare occassion
        this number can be less than the requested amount).

    _configure_daq() -> None
        Internal method to configure the DAQ and `NidaqEdgeCounterInterface`. Starts
        the internal clock cycle if an external one is not provided.

    def sample_nbatches_raw(self, n_batches=1, sum_counts=True) -> np.ndarray:
        '''
        This method reads `n_batches` of batch reads returning the "raw" output of
        the `self._read_samples()` method.

        If the raw output is too verbose there are several derivative methods available 
        for reduced or modified output:
        1. `self.sample_nbatches_counts()`: Returns only the total counts per each batch
        2. `self.sample_nbatches_time()`  : Converts number of clock cycles to total time 
                                            per batch
        3. `self.sample_nbatches_rate()`  : Converts the total counts per batch and the
                                            number of cycles per batch into a count rate
                                            per batch. Returns only this value.

        For most practical cases, one may only be interested in sampling a single batch.
        In such cases users are pointed to `self.sample_batch_raw()` or its own 
        derivative methods which may be slightly faster.

        Parameters
        ----------
        n_batches : int
            The number of batches to sample
        sum_counts : bool
            If `True` (default) integrates the individual batch samples to obtain a
            single tuple (see Notes). If `False`, then each batch counts and number
            of samples are stored in an `(n_batches, 2)`-shaped array.

        Returns
        -------
        np.ndarray
            An array of tuple pairs corresponding to (counts, number of samples) for each
            batch resulting in an array of shape `(n_batches,2)`. If `sum_counts=True` then 
            each batch is integrated so that so that the output is a 2-tuple of the total 
            number of counts and number of clock cycles.
        
        Notes
        -----
        For each batch read (of size `num_data_samples_per_batch`), the total counts are
        summed. Because it's possible (though unlikely) for the hardware to return fewer 
        than `num_data_samples_per_batch` measurements, the actual number of data samples 
        per batch are also recorded.

        If sum_counts is False, a numpy array of shape (n_batches, 2) is returned, where
        the first element is the sum of the counts, and the second element is
        the actual number of clock samples per batch. This may be useful for the caller if
        they wish to perform their own averaging or other statistical analysis that may be 
        time dependent.

        For example, if `self.num_data_samples_per_batch` is 5 and n_batches is 3,
        then reading counts from the NiDAQ may return

        #sample 1
        raw_counts_1 = [3,5,4,6,4] 
        # ^ there are num_data_samples_per_batch=5 requested samples in this batch
        sum_counts_1 = 22
        size_counts_1 = 5
           summed batch 1: (22, 5)
        #sample 2
        raw_counts_2 = [5,5,7,3,4]
        sum_counts_2 = 24
        size_counts_2 = 5
           summed batch 2: (24, 5)
        #sample 3
        raw_counts_3 = [5,3,5,7] # nidaq may return fewer than num_data_samples_per_batch
        sum_counts_3 = 20
        size_counts_2 = 4
           summed batch 3: (20, 4)

        The summed batch values are combined into a numpy array of shape (3, 2)

        data = [
                [22, 5],
                [24, 5],
                [20, 4]
               ]
        If sum_counts is False, this numpy array of shape (3,2) will be returned.

        If sum_counts is True, data will be summed along axis=0 with keepdim=True,
        resulting in a numpy array of shape (1, 2).
        Following the example, the return value would be [[66, 14]].

        n_batches : int
            The number of batches to sample
        sum_counts : bool
            If `True` (default) integrates the individual batch samples to obtain a
            single tuple (see Notes). If `False`, then each batch counts and number
            of samples are stored in an `(n_batches, 2)`-shaped array.

        Returns
        -------
        np.ndarray
            An array of tuple pairs corresponding to (counts, time_in_seconds) for each
            batch resulting in an array of shape `(n_batches,2)`. If `sum_counts=True` then 
            each batch is integrated so that so that the output is a 2-tuple of the total 
            number of counts and time in seconds.

        -------
        np.ndarray
            An array corresponding to the countrate per batch. If `sum_counts=True` 
            then the array is collapsed into a single number.
